# RXLMN
RXLMN is a professional contact relationship manager designed specifically to be over-the-top fast, flexible, and most importantly, reliable.

It derives its speed from using an indexed database, which can return hundreds of results in miliseconds. Additionally, its search operation builder allows users to create complex queries with ease.

True flexiblity can only be achived if the user can modify data structures to their will and not forced to a specific template. Naturally, RXLMN implements this by allowing users to edit the ENTIRE schema of their data.

Critically, the app can function in any enviroment; online, offline, or slow connection. This means regardless of connection, RXLMN continues to function exactly like normal, and will upload your changes as soon as it goes back online.
